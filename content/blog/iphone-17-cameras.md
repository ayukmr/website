    title: iPhone 17 lineup's new camera designs
---

There have been many rumors surrounding the new camera bar design of the iPhone 17 lineup, but this one seems a lot more substantial as it shows the new cameras in the context of the entire lineup. Compared to the Pixel 9's new camera bar style which has allowed the Pixel line to appear much more premium, the iPhone 17 Pro's camera seems to just be a result of Apple trying to create _some_ hardware difference between the 16 Pro and 17 Pro. For the past few phones, this differentiation has been created through a new featureâ€”the Dynamic Island on the 14 Pro, the Action Button on the 15 Pro, and most recently the Camera Control button on the 16 Pro. However, Apple isn't able to sustain repetitively adding new buttons, leading to the creation of unnecessary design elements like the camera rectangle on the 17 Pro. Personally, I much prefer the [plateauing design model of the Galaxy phones](/blog/s25-identical), where consumers are expected to only upgrade their phone every few years.
