    title: OpenAI is building a social network
---

Further proving the content-based monetization approach I discussed in [the previous post](/blog/xai-acquires-x) is OpenAI, who is said to be working on its own social network as a competitor to X. OpenAI is obviously solely in the LLMs game and doesn't have an advertising division to fully take advantage of the aggregate views harnessed by a social media network, making it apparent that they're instead going to use the network to gather human-written content for use in training. Since Meta and xAI—two large players in foundation models—control enormous social media networks (Google, alas, gave up this advantage with the shutting down of Google+), this new network is likely going to be used by OpenAI to balance out the short-form content that it lacks through other sources like Reddit.
