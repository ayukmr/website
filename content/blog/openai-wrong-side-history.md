Sam Altman, in response to a request to release model weights:
> yes, we are discussing. i personally think we have been on the wrong side of history here and need to figure out a different open source strategy; not everyone at openai shares this view, and it's also not our current highest priority.

I saw this comment on Slashdot yesterday, but didn't realize that it came from Altman's _personal_ Reddit account. I previously assumed that Altman said this in a conversation with some politician, where absolutely nothing could be taken literally without considering OpenAI's motives.

I still don't think that this Reddit comment can be really considered as OpenAI going back to open source, especially since Altman has so much leverage in terms of the company's plans and could have previously attempted to pivot to a more open company. This discrepancy is especially obvious even when comparing OpenAI to Anthropic, who doesn't publish open model weights but at least attempts to make parts of their technology more accessible for usage without a \$200/month subscription.

This comment is obviously catered towards the audience who thinks that OpenAI is going to implode because of DeepSeek, but there's not really any advantage for OpenAI to open source their stack since the company is well established compared to the Chinese AI lab. I would guess that the main reasoning for this comment is just to give investors _something_ to work with when considering OpenAI's status compared to other AI companies (of course, primarily DeepSeek), so I wouldn't derive any real meaning out of it.
