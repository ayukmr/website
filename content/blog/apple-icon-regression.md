> If you put the Apple icons in reverse it looks like the portfolio of someone getting really really good at icon design

A very correct take.

I don't really get how the oldest ink pot icon is the 'best', but the new liquid glass icons are so much worse than the others that it's genuinely saddening. I personally think that the initial Big Sur icons were the epitome of Apple's modern icon designs.
