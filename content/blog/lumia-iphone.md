I've never really liked the design of the Nokia Windows Phones, but this mod honestly looks great. I think a large part of why it looks so good is because of the symmetrical bezel created by the removal of the hardware navigation buttons, which was required to fit the larger iPhone SE display into the Lumia body. I especially love putting the fingerprint sensor on the huge camera bump, in a position reminiscent of phones like the Pixel 5.
