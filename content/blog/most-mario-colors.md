    title: The most Mario colors
---

This post from Louie Mantia features one of my favorite types of analysis: collecting a lot of data to answer a seemingly obvious question and finding interesting patterns in the process. I hadn't previously noticed the large variety of letter colors in the different Mario games, with the most common combinations only being present in at most 5 games of the 40 shown. Also of a similar style, I really liked [these](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XejJ6PzPtEw) [videos](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-Ddmjcy3lEs) by jan Misali which cover the interesting question of what games are specifically in the _Super_ Mario series (both videos are definitely worth the long durations).
