The Supreme Court has upheld the ban-or-sale ruling, further supporting TikTok's planned shutdown on Sunday. [This article](https://noahpinion.blog/p/tiktok-is-just-the-beginning) (via [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/15/noah-smith-tiktok-china)) gives a good explanation of why TikTok is being shutdown instead of being sold like other apps:
> But a simpler explanation is that Chinese leaders simply think that TikTok, unlike other apps, is so important that they would rather destroy it than see it escape their control.

While I support the initiative to reduce foreign influence and data collection, even when not considering the questionable violation of free speech, simply banning TikTok is not going to be effective since people are already moving to alternatives that have equivalent problems.
