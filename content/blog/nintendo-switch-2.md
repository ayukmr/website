There have been a lot of Switch 2 leaks over the past year and they seem to have held up pretty well. Most of the improvements seem pretty solid except the new colorway, which I dislike because it takes away from the fun, vibrant aesthetic that Nintendo has been known for. Also, I find the new logo to be pretty awful due to the '2' being way too big, especially since they could have just kept the old Switch logo. Hopefully the magnetic Joy-Cons fare a lot better than the older ones, as stick drift has been a recurring issue over the lifespan of the first Switch console.
