    title: The state of the Galaxy series is really boring
---

The Galaxy S25 series being identical to the S24 series was the main takeaway by most news sources after this year's Galaxy Unpacked. While this point is extremely valid and further shows the general staleness of phone designs over the last couple of years, I don't see how Samsung can really win here. For example, in the case of Apple, moving the cameras around for seemingly arbitrary reasons has been mocked by many people, especially outside of the tech community. For Samsung, with their Galaxy S series being widely considered a pinnacle of smartphone hardware, there's no good reason for them to deviate from their formula to make their phones more unique. This holds especially true since most people only upgrade their phone every few years, meaning that cumulative spec bumps create more of an impact than completely changing the phone's design language. Though, I still do find it a bit sad that Samsung abandoned the stylized camera bump of the S21 and S22 series, since those are probably my favorite phone designs ever.
