A new AI startup cofounded by FranÃ§ois Chollet, the creator of Keras. Ndea's main focus seems to be developing AGI, which is obviously a shared interest of all the major AI companies.

As described on their website, Ndea is utilizing _guided program synthesis_ to reach AGI:
> Instead of interpolating between data points in a continuous embedding space, program synthesis searches for discrete programs, or models, that perfectly explain observed data.

While their description of program synthesis is a bit overcomplicated, it seems to simply be searching for certain programs that interpret and output data in a correct way. Since this program search can be guided through deep learning, Ndea claims that programs can be found which perfectly model observed data without necessitating compromises.

It will be interesting to see if this startup will be able to make a large, independent impact on AI research, or if it will just be another endeavour that results in being acquired by a larger company.
