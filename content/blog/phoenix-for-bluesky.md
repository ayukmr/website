Although I vastly prefer the usability of Android compared to iOS, there are a few apps that I've been envious of not having replacements to. One is Halide: there's no real replacement for a product created of such care and attention to detail, especially with the app's ability to cater to both normal and professional users. Another—more specifically when I used to use Mastodon—is Ivory, with its beautifully designed UI and icons making it preferable even compared to the great client I used to use on Android, Tusky. However, as many have noted, Mastodon attracted a very small, selective audience of people compared to other alternative networks like Bluesky and Threads. As such, with Bluesky's recent growth and wide reception as a more standard social network, I'm super excited to see how Phoenix will turn out. I especially hope that Tapbots follows a similar route as Ivory, releasing a Mac app after the iOS app has been out for a bit, as I've been looking for a Bluesky client with good keyboard shortcuts (which Ivory for Mac specifically had as a feature on its roadmap).
