While this article misses the recurring environmental impacts from different companies racing to train increasingly better LLMs, it provides a good analysis of the impacts of individual ChatGPT questions. I've always noted that promoting individual behavior changes has little impact on preventing environmental damage, and found this quote to be especially good for proving that point:
> Getting worried about whether you should use LLMs is as much of a distraction to the real issues involved with climate change as worrying about whether you should stop the YouTube video youâ€™re watching 12 seconds early for the sake of the Earth.

While watching 12 seconds of a YouTube video and asking a ChatGPT question are obviously not able to be directly compared, it's pretty clear that neither are especially important to worry about in terms of their impact. However, I do agree that the promotion of LLMs will cause further model training which causes more environmental impacts, but hopefully the necessity for training entirely new models will diminish quickly as the relative increase of model performance plateaus.
