I'm a bit late to reading it, but I just finished _The Three-Body Problem_ and it was pretty good. I liked the different scientific concepts that the book is heavily based around, and had fun trying to find logical gaps in the concepts I'm more familiar with (there weren't any). I did find the ending to not really conclude anything, meaning that reading the next book is pretty much required for having an actual conclusion.
