After several scrubbed launches (the most recent one being a few days ago), Blue Origin has finally launched the New Glenn rocket. The video of the launch is accessible on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KXysNxbGdCg&t=6859s), with the link leading to the launch at T-20. While I'm not knowledgable about the specific logistics around launches, New Glenn going into orbit on its first flight seems to be unique according to [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725579) Hacker News comment.
