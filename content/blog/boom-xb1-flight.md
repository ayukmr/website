Super cool to see Boom's XB-1 breaking the sound barrier on its first supersonic flight. I enjoyed [this explanation](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-qisIViAHwI&t=3268s) by one of the commentators covering the difficulties with reaching supersonic speeds and how XB-1's design optimizes its performance. As an aside, the flight information is really nicely displayed in the livestream, with the Mach being front-and-center since Boom's main objective is to achieve a value > 1. I've also appreciated the same high quality of displayed information in SpaceX and Blue Origin's streams, with the shown stats being carefully chosen to not cause unnecessary clutter.
