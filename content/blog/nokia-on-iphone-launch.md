An interesting internal presentation from Nokia comparing the iPhone to the existing phone landscape. They repeatedly note the importance of the "coolness" factor to the iPhone's future success, which has completely held true even in Apple's current strategy. Nokia also foresaw the importance of the partnership between Apple and Cingular (now AT&T) to promoting the growth of the iPhone through integrated services. Overall, most of Nokia's predictions were spot-on and show a deep understanding of the iPhone's strengths, even though Nokia was unable to survive in the market itself.
