Cool demo of the concerning program execution that is built into PDFs. I initially assumed that PostScript was used to add logic, but it apparently instead uses JavaScript, which I didn't know was able to be embedded into PDFs. Note that it doesn't seem to work in Preview.app, but it does work in the builtin PDF viewers in Chrome and Firefox.
