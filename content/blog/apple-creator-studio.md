The icons are horrific. Glad to see that Pixelmator Pro will be keeping its name as part of this new suite, though.

Hopefully pushing towards a work suite will mean that live collaboration becomes closer to that of Google Workspace, since that's still the main reason I often use Slides over the superior choice, Keynote.
