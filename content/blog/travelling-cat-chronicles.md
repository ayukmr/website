I recently read _The Travelling Cat Chronicles_ and found it quite good. I enjoyed the format of the book, where a short introduction leads into multiple interconnected stories. Aside from that, there is of course the main highlight of the bookâ€”the experiences of the novel are chronicled through the perspective of a cat. I found the story to be a bit overly dramatic at times, but still recommend checking out the book as it was a nice read.
